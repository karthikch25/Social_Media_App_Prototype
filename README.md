A new Flutter project made for my intern members to sociaize things related to company within.

An Application made to build a Community platform for an already built website developed during my internship, where I worked on fetching data from the databases like MySQL,RDBMS used in the website, core interface stubbing, storage management and many more. Built a single community chat service for all the members  in it using firebase.
